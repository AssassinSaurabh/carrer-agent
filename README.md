Profile Agent ðŸ¤–

Profile Agent is a personal AI chatbot designed to represent you and your professional skills in a natural, conversational way. Unlike simple tools that extract information from files, this agent can actively engage with users, answer questions about your experience, projects, and expertise, and convey your knowledge with a tone that reflects your personal style.

Built with modern AI technologies, Profile Agent leverages OpenAIâ€™s language models to generate context-aware responses, making interactions feel intuitive and human-like. It provides a seamless way for people to learn about you and your work without requiring you to be present, effectively acting as your digital representative.

The chatbot is easy to set up and customize, allowing you to tailor the responses, tone, and knowledge base according to your professional profile. Whether for networking, showcasing your skills, or providing information about your projects, Profile Agent serves as a smart, interactive extension of yourself.
